# Ross-Sec-Audio Site

This is my personal site (Ross Prendergast).

My goal here is to collaborate with nice people and to create fun and interesting projects.

This website includes projects relating to:

- Information Security Research 
- Other infoSec/IT/development projects
- Music Composition & Production
- My opinions on Politics & Social Science
- My opinions on art

### The Purpose of this Site

I've created this site as a single place to showcase the silly things I've written and developed. 

With regard to the content on this site, I don't claim to be an expert of any discipline covered. 

I'm using this site in an attempt to improve my understanding of the topics I cover and to improve upon my writing and communication skills. 

There's nothing like hard-earned practice so here we go, warts and all. 

The views and opinions on this site are my own and are not representative of my employer(s).

### About this Site

I'm hosting this site using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/ "GitHub Pages"), and it's developed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll"). 

This keeps things very simple through Markdown, along with a small bit of CSS, HTML and JavaScript.
