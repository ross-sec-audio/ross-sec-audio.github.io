## Best Practice

Throughout my career in InfoSec, I must have heard the term "Information Security best practice" thousands of times. I didn't think too much about it until recently, waving it off as a heuristic way to describe how something is "appropriately secured", or "secured in line with what international banks are doing".

But the term bothered me. I knew some colleagues who had distaste for it, but I hadn't fully understood why. 

This short post will outline the ways in which this term impairs critical thinking and hampers inclusivity in our industry.

## Losses in Critical Thinking

"Best practice" infers a single, most right way of doing a particular thing. This is not the case in information security. 

There is no "best".

All identified information or cyber security risks will be specific to each organisation, based on their assets, their asset configurations, the data being processed by those assets, and the organisational use cases.

This all means that the resulting treatment or remediation plan for any given risk should consider these contextual elements. Many remediation plans might look the same (e.g., deploy the vendor's patch to address the vulnerability), but their implementation will look very different in each organisation, due to the aforementioned.

I used the term "appropriately secured" earlier in this post on purpose, as it infers that context-specific risks were addressed through the implementation of commensurate security controls which are fit for their purpose. 

This means that each security problem will have its own organisation-specific and contextually aware "appropriate" control, but these controls cannot be collated and aggregated into the book of the best security, for all to digest and implement in the exact same way.

“Best Practice” infers that security practitioners can just look at the textbook and recommend bland and potentially useless solutions to identified risks and issues.

You can try that if you want, and to be honest, if you do, you'll probably still do great in your career and no one will call you out on regurgitating test book answers to textbook problems, but you won't be creating much value. 

A belief that there is such thing as "Information Security best practice", removes the practitioner's need to think critically about the challenge or problem their organisation is facing. 

## Non-Inclusive Language & Ideas

In linguistic anthropology there is a well-regarded hypothesis, called the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, that the structure and content of a language determines a native speaker's perception and categorization of experience. In other words, the language that we use on a day-to-day basis, and its underlying meaning and etymology, can and will have an influence on how we view and frame the world around us. 

The point above on the lack of critical thinking in relation to this term was included as a standalone point, but also to frame the idea that the belief in "best practice" promotes a potentially harmful way of thinking about the world around us. It promotes that there is the right way to do something and a million wrong ways. 

“Best practice” infers a singular correct approach to a spectrum of problems and challenges.

This approach leaves no space for differing perspectives, approaches, and insights.

In a middle-aged, white, and cis-male dominated industry, we risk excluding innovative and novel ways to address common and challenging security risks, through the exclusion of the people who will proffer that innovation.

We shouldn't be promoting only one means to be secure. Instead, we should be inclusively looking for interesting and diverse new ways to improve upon existing practices.

Improving equality, diversity, and inclusion is not just the ethically justified thing to do (although that should be enough of a reason to do anything), it will also improve our industry's approach to problem-solving, innovation, and delivery of secure processes and technology.

## What to do

To conclude, the term “information security best practice”, while invasive in our industry, can be dangerous.

We should kill it with fire. 

Long live "good practices".
