## Welcome to my Portfolio and Blog
Hey there! 

I've created this site so I've a single place to showcase the silly things I've written and developed. 

I'm hosting this site using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/ "GitHub Pages"), and it's developed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll"). This keeps things very simple through Markdown, along with a small bit of CSS, HTML and JavaScript.

### I'm going to use this site to chat about
I'm interested in lots of stuff, but I'm planning to mainly discuss the following topics:

1. Information Security
2. Programming & Development
3. Music Production
4. Other musings on the world

> **Note**: If you'd like me to cover anything in particular, to chat with me about anything or if you'd like to collaborate on a project please don't hesitate to get in touch - [Email](mailto:info@example.com "Email me")
