## Welcome to my Portfolio and Blog
Hey there! 

I've created this site so I've a single place to showcase the silly things I've written and developed. 

I'm hosting this site using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/ "Github Pages") and it's developed using Jekyll, which keeps things very simple through Markdown.

#### This Site
I'm going to use this site to chat about:

1. Information Security
2. Programming & Development (Wee projects I've completed for the craic)
3. Music Production
4. Other musings on the world

> **Note**: If you'd like me to cover anything in particular, to chat with me about anything or if you'd like to collaborate on a project please don't hesitate to get in touch - [Email](mailto:info@example.com "Email me")
