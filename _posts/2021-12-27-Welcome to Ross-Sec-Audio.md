> Introduction to this site and the blog.
<!--more-->

Hey there! 

I've created this site to learn and showcase the silly things I've learned, written, and developed.

I don't claim to be an expert on any topics covered here, so if I've made an error or misunderstood something, please do let me know. I'd be happy to update posts as required.

Mainly, I'm using this site to improve my understanding of InfoSec, Technology, Music Production, Culture, and Politics.

I'm hosting this site using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/ "GitHub Pages"), and it's developed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll"). This keeps things very simple through Markdown, along with a bit of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

## Topics
I'm interested in lots of stuff, but I'm planning to write about the following topics:

1. Information Security
2. Programming & Software Development
3. Music Production
4. Live music coding
5. Other musings on the world (i.e. politics, social science, anthropology, etc.)
