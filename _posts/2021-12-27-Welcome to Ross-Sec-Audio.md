Hey there! 

I've created this site as a single place to showcase the silly things I've written and developed. 

I don't claim to be an expert on any topics covered here, so if I've made an error or misunderstood something, please do let me know. I'd be happy to update posts as required, citing your feedback.

I'm using this site to improve my understanding of InfoSec, Music Production, and Politics. But I also see this as an opportunity to improve my writing and communication skills. 

There's nothing like hard-earned practice so here we go, warts and all. 

I'm hosting this site using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/ "GitHub Pages"), and it's developed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll"). This keeps things very simple through Markdown, along with a bit of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

## Topics
I'm interested in lots of stuff, but I'm planning to write about the following topics:

1. Information Security
2. Programming & Software Development
3. Music Production
4. Other musings on the world (i.e. politics, social science, anthropology, etc.)
