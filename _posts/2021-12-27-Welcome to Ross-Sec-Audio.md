My goal here is to document my thoughts.

This website includes projects relating to:

- Information Security Research 
- Other infoSec/IT/development projects
- Music Composition & Production    
- My opinions on Politics & Social Science
- My opinions on art

### The Purpose of this Site

I've created this site to log my thoughts and opinions. 

With regard to the content on this site, I don't claim to be an expert of any discipline covered. 

I'm using this site in an attempt to improve my understanding of the topics I cover and to improve my writing and communication skills. 

The views and opinions on this site are my own and are not representative of my employer(s).

## About this Site

I'm hosting this site using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/ "GitHub Pages"), and it uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll") as the static site generator.

This keeps things very simple with Markdown, and small bits of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.
