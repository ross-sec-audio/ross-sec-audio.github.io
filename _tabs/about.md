Hi There,

I'm an Information Security professional, who also likes producing music. 

In 2010, I completed my master's degree in Music Composition and Computer Music. Since then, I have been working in IT and InfoSec, but still love writing, producing, and playing music.

My goal here is to collaborate with nice people and to create fun and interesting projects.

This website includes projects relating to:

1. Information Security
2. Programming & Software Development
3. Music Production
4. Other musings on the world (i.e. politics, social science, anthropology, etc.)

### The Purpose of this Site

I've created this site to showcase the silly things I've written and developed. But also, to improve my understanding of InfoSec, Music Production, and Politics. But I also see this as an opportunity to improve my writing and communication skills. 

There's nothing like hard-earned practice so here we go, warts and all. 

I don't claim to be an expert on any topics covered here, so if I've made an error or misunderstood something, please do let me know. I'd be happy to update posts as required, citing your feedback.

The views and opinions on this site are my own and are not representative of my employer.

### About this Site

I'm hosting this site using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/ "GitHub Pages"), and it's developed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll"). 

This keeps things very simple through Markdown, along with a bit of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.
