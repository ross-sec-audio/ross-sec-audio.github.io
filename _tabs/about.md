Hi There,

I work in InfoSec and I also like producing music.

In 2010, I completed my master's degree in Music Composition and Computer Music. Since then, I have been working in IT and InfoSec.

My goal here is to share some of my interests and to collaborate with nice people.

The site includes content relating to:

1. Information Security
2. Software Development & Architecture
3. Music Production
4. Other musings on the world (i.e. art, politics, social science, anthropology, etc.)

The views and opinions on this site are my own and are not representative of my employer.

## About this Site

I'm hosting this site using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/ "GitHub Pages"), and it uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll") as the static site generator.

This keeps things very simple with Markdown, and small bits of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.
